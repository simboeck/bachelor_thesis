# bachelor_thesis

The code provided within this repository has been created in the course of my bachelor thesis. 
In total there are two notebooks: 
- pipeline with the APIs
- the calculation of the evaluation metrics

Furthermore the input txt files are available as well as the bachelor thesis, which you can read if interested.
